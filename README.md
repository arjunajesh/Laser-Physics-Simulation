# Laser Simulation Game
### Link to Simulation on Github Pages:
https://arjunajesh.github.io/Laser-Simulation-Game/Builds/index.html

This project is intended to be an interactive simulation of how a beam of light would interact through a system of mirrors and blocks.

### Instructions
Turn on the Laser by clicking on the laser pointer (black rectangle). 
You can move any of the objects in the scene by dragging and dropping
You can also rotate any object by hovering over the object with the mouse and using the scroll wheel.
You can spawn in additional mirrors or glass blocks by clicking the respective buttons in the top left corner
The lasers will reflect off mirros and refract through the glass blocks(the index of refraction used is 1.5)
If you would like to delete any of the objects, you can drag the item to the "Trash" in the top right corner
